<h1 align="center">ABOUT NEFFEX</h1>
<p>
    Music has surrounded our lives for centuries. From Beethoven to Rhianna and everything in between, music
    has evolved and changed quite a bit. Personally, I have never been musically inclined. Learning to play “Hot
    Cross Buns” on a recorder is the extent of my musical career. Upon interviewing Neffex, an up and coming
    electronic-rap genre based band created by two best friends. Meeting up with Neffex’s creators, Cameron
    Wales and Brandon Horth, was an absolute honor. The music intelligence they both possessed was admirable.

    Asking both of them out to dinner at Olive Garden was a success. After all, who could resist those
    breadsticks? Before showering them with questions, we engaged in a casual conversation and devoured the
    pasta dishes in front of us. I decided to begin the interview with the simple question of, “why music?” They
    both laughed and jokingly responded, “why not?” According to Jeremy Wade Morris, the music industry is a
    competitive and difficult business to prosper in. In fact, approximately 91 percent of musical artists are
    completely undiscovered. Even though it is not easy to be successful in the music industry, Cameron
    expressed that music is something that has always been held near and dear to both of them and it is a risk
    they are willing to take. “It is something that [we] have always truly enjoyed doing. I have been creating
    music since I can remember and it helps me get through my day, so why not start a music project and try to
    build it into something?” They currently have over 45 thousand followers on Instagram alone. Their songs
    are beginning to spread to people through other means of social media and famous YouTubers are showcasing
    their music in videos. Although Neffex has only just begun their music career, the popularity that is already
    building can make this project a success.
